# ART BY BORI Webpage

## This is my first webpage, created for uni assignement
Really enjoy making these, I already spen countless hours on it, learning HTML and CSS on my own. I'm kind of getting the hang of it.

After this semester is over, I like to learn some techs in the summer, and continue to make Sites for practice.

Technologies I'd like to learn
1. JavaScript
2. TailWind
3. React
